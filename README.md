# Synsight

## Overview

- Synsight ("synesthesia" + "sight") a different kind of facial recognition system.  It replaces the faces in images with colorful uniquely-identifying textures and patterns.

- The space of possible patterns is orders of magnitude richer than the highly constrained space of variations on human facial features, so the patterns are more quickly, easily, and clearly recognizable than the face imagery they replace.

- Faces can't be recognized in parallel by humans particularly well.  However, other modalities like color can be (eg, "find the red object in the field of blue objects"), and even more modalities in subjects with synesthesia.  Due to the switch to more human vision parallel-friendly means such as color in the generated patterns, this system will make you superhuman at recognizing Waldo in crowds ("1 to N").

- The system was originally designed to allow people with prosopagnosia to identify faces.  It does this by bypassing the specialized brain regions involved in face perception by transforming faces to visual structurally-generic textures and patterns instead.  It should make your face recognition performance comparably super ("0 to N").
